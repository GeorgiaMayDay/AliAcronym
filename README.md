# Slack Bot template

This is my slack bot template 

Initially created following this guide: https://python.plainenglish.io/lets-create-a-slackbot-cause-why-not-2972474bf5c1

Hopefully going to turn into an acroymn explainer bot

# WIP: Currently

I need to add some kind of nested structure to allow for the same acronym having multiple meanings

So the current thinking for this is:

Make the Acronym data struct include the acronym class. 
Use that to get to display all relevant data from a multi-acronym datastore.
Think this is cute. Will probably also want to add a jargon command
