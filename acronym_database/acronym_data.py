In addition, the CFR data is being used to populate part of the Section 52 Outturn Statements and for analytical work in the Department. CFR increases the level of accountability of school managers whilst prompting schools to become more self-managing. The ideology that each school is in the position to make the best decisions about allocating resources is at the core of CFR. Access to benchmarked data will allow school managers to make better-informed decisions when deciding annual budgets, thus improving overall efficiency year on year. CFR will facilitate networking between schools and encourage 'learning by looking': less efficient schools will be expected to look to more successful schools for advice on best practice. The approved headings for the CFR framework came into force on 1 April 2003 in preparation for the first full data collection exercise.

There are currently a number of definitions of child sexual exploitation in use by voluntary organisations and agencies. This has led to some confusion and additional challenges for practitioners working with children and families, creating inconsistencies in risk assessment and data collection. The government aims to provide clarity so all professionals are using the same definition of child sexual exploitation in their work to prevent abuse and investigate offending. The proposed definition is: Child sexual exploitation is a form of child abuse. It occurs where anyone under the age of 18 is persuaded, coerced or forced into sexual activity in exchange for, amongst other things, money, drugs/alcohol, gifts, affection or status. Consent is irrelevant, even where a child may believe they are voluntarily engaging in sexual activity with the person who is exploiting them. Child sexual exploitation does not always involve physical contact and may occur online.

The local authorities in the first wave of pilots were: Northumberland (North East Region) Sefton (North West Region) Bradford (Yorkshire & Humber Region) Nottinghamshire (East Midlands Region) Solihull (West Midlands Region) Luton (Eastern England Region) Barking & Dagenham (London Region) Camden (London Region) Oxfordshire (South East Region) Cornwall (South West Region)  In 2010-11 funding was provided to every LA to allow them to focus on one or more areas of improvement, depending on their local needs and priorities: Better data: estimating demand and monitoring take up Participation and feedback: consulting with families Improving information for families Supporting families to make choices Workforce development Increasing capacity, inclusion and improving quality Meeting particular childcare needs Affordability and cost.Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-06-05",

It aims to show that, with the right resources, it is possible to overcome the literacy difficulties that blight so many children's lives.  The initiative is funding highly-skilled Reading Recovery teachers in inner-city schools, to provide intensive help to children most in need. The immediate aim is to reach 5,000 children, particularly those living in areas of high social deprivation. It forms part of the government's London Challenge, a partnership between all who seek more for London's young people. It eventually aims to help 30,000 children with severe literacy difficulties by 2010-11. Longer term, the initiative aims to secure sustainable investment in early literacy intervention, and to explore how intensive support in reading can be provided most cost effectively in a national context. The Department has provided the initiative with matched funding of 4.55 million over three years. ECAR resulted from recommendations made in the Rose Review which identified that 'some children...have neuro-developmental disorders and other special educational needs that may present formidable obstacles to learning to read and write...' and goes on to discuss effective approaches to support children at risk of underachievement.",

EDP have now been superseded by Raising Achievement Plans. There are three key elements to an EDP: 1.The LA targets for raising pupil attainment, and improving attendance at school 2.An audit of pupil attainment in the LA area under each of the five national priorities set out in the guidance (primary; KS2; KS3; tackling underperformance; schools causing concern) 3.A programme for school improvement and raising pupil attainment based on the local audit The second generation of EDP (for 2002-07) was approved by the Secretary of State in March 2002. A condition of approval of the EDP was that LA annually submit a report evaluating the EDP and a list of their school-improvement activities for the coming year. This material will not be required in the future, giving local authorities time to prepare the Children and Young People's Plan which they will have in place by April 2006, following the introduction of the Children and Young Persons Bill which repealed the EDP legislation.",

It took over the functions previously carried out by Partnerships for Schools and the Young People's Learning Agency as well as the DfE. The EFA had over 700 staff based in 11 offices, as well as a number of remote workers. The chief executive was Peter Lauener. Its main function was to fund the education system for 3-19 year olds (or up to the age of 25 for disabled students). This covered pupils in academies, in local authority maintained schools and in 16-19 education and training. The EFA also supported the delivery of capital programmes for schools, academies, free schools and sixth form colleges. The EFAs principal responsibilities were: to distribute the Dedicated Schools Grant for the education of pupils up to age 16 in local authority maintained schools; to provide funding for all 16-19 education and training; to provide funding for learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities aged 16-24; and to support the delivery of capital programmes for schools, academies, Free Schools and sixth form colleges. EFA was arranged into four groups to achieve this: Academies; Young People; Capital; and Finance, performance and maintained schools. The creation of the EFA made it clear that the line of accountability for the funding of the education system is to ministers. Bringing together capital and revenue expertise into a single body provided an excellent opportunity for streamlining the funding system and making it more efficient and effective.",

But unlike its predecessor which was supported and funded by government around the supporting the exam systems in operation, the iEOA is returning to its roots that revolve around centre needs and those communities and not just around facilitating an exam system in which this community has had very little say in or influence on over the years.

In October 1993, with financial support from the European Commission, a group of researchers working in the field of parents in education in different parts of Europe met in Glasgow to discuss how to increase contact across Europe, to exchange knowledge of research developments in Europe and to stimulate research about parents in education at all levels, including intercultural European research. The group decided to establish ERNAPE and to organise this research network by language areas, rather than by countries. The term \"parents in education\" is intended to include both the relationship of parents to school systems and the contributions which parents and families make to their child's learning outside school. The field of research about parents in education and families in education is increasingly being recognised as vitally important. ERNAPE will be relevant to anyone researching in the areas of education, educational administration, educational psychology, educational sociology and related disciplines. ERNAPE will also be of interest to parents, teachers and their organisations. ERNAPE is an independent body, not tied to any political, religious or other ideological groups. The purposes of ERNAPE are: information exchange between researchers and organisations; interaction in doing research: design of joint programmes, analysis and reflection on parents in education; stimulating awareness of the field; supporting/educating young researchers in the field of parents in education.

The Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) was responsible for calculating and paying grants to the governing bodies of Grant Maintained Schools which were provided for under the Education Reform Act 1988. It also monitored the financial position of Grant Maintained schools. The FAS supported Grant Maintained schools on special measures or with serious weaknesses, following an adverse Ofsted inspection. Its remit was extended in its later years to include responsibility for the monitoring and regulation of Grant Maintained schools' commercial borrowing. By 1997 the FAS had shared responsibility with the Local Education Authority (LEA) for secondary provision in 49 LEAs, and for primary provision in 7 LEAs; and full responsibility for secondary provision in 3 LEAs.

The profile is made up of 13 scales based on the early learning goals and stepping stones set out in Curriculum guidance for the foundation stage. The Foundation Stage Profile Handbook provides guidance for practitioners on how to make assessments on the basis of their observations and knowledge of the whole child. Recording attainment A child's attainment on the 13 scales can be recorded in a Foundation Stage Profile booklet or the eProfile. These are optional; schools and settings may want to use their own systems. Whichever is used, there is no need for extensive collections of evidence for individual children and no need to complete more than one record. Using the stepping stones and early learning goals The stepping stones and Early Learning Goals are used throughout the foundation stage for planning and assessing learning. The stepping stones (non-statutory) show the kind of knowledge, skills, understanding and attitudes that children are expected to need if they are to achieve the early learning goals. The early learning goals, which are statutory, establish the expectations for most children by the end of the foundation stage. Curriculum guidance for the foundation stage provides examples of 'what children do' that will help practitioners identify how children in their setting are progressing. Fit with Key Stage 1 The foundation stage areas of learning can be mapped onto the subject-based KS1 curriculum. How schools organise the curriculum in KS1 is for them to decide and there is sufficient flexibility for schools to adapt the content and pedagogy to their children's needs. The National Assessment Agency (NAA) is developing guidance for teachers on using the foundation stage profile data to plan for children's progression in Year 1.Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-07",

Further information from The Knowledge accessed 2019-03-26: Background In 1976 the Schools Council recommended that the GCE and CSE examinations be replaced with a common system of examining at 16+. In 1977 the Department of Education and Science (DES) set up a Steering Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir James Waddell. In July 1978 it produced a report called \"School Examinations\". Cmnd 7281 (HMSO, 1978). The government accepted the recommendations for a single examination at 16+ to be called the General Certificate of Secondary Education in a White Paper called \"Secondary School Examinations; a Single System at 16 Plus\", Cmnd 7368 (HMSO, 1978). After further discussions the DES issued \"Examinations at 16-plus: a statement of policy\" in November 1982, which announced the future examination boards and the structure of the examinations. The starting dates were announced by Sir Keith Joseph on 20 June 1984 in a statement in the House of Commons (DES PN 101/84): courses were to begin in September 1986 with the first GCSE examinations in Summer 1988. Applied GCSEs The Secretary of State for Education and Skills announced the new GCSE initiative in June 2000. The Applied GCSEs were introduced for first teaching from September 2002 as GCSEs in vocational subjects. Applied GCSEs are designed to: Introduce learners to a broad sector of industry and business Encourage understanding of the sector, key concepts and theories prevalent in it Develop capability in some skills used within it Nine titles are currently [date unknown] available: Applied Art and Design; Applied Business; Applied ICT; Engineering; Health and Social Care; Leisure and Tourism; Manufacturing; Applied Performing Arts and Applied Science.",

While following a training plan that leads to Qualified Teacher Status, trainees are employed by schools as qualified or unqualified teachers and paid accordingly. The programmes have proved particularly suitable routes to qualification for mature people with financial responsibilities; for people from ethnic minority groups and for people with previous experience in schools, for example, as classroom assistants and instructors. They have also helped many schools to find suitable staff for difficult to fill posts and to train them on the job. The Graduate Teacher Programme (GTP) is open to graduates with a first degree (or equivalent) who are either aged 24 or over or successfully completed recognised teacher training overseas. The Registered Teacher Programme (RTP) is open to people who have been accepted onto a programme leading to a first degree (or equivalent qualification) and who are either aged 24 or over and have some higher education or comparable education or who have successfully completed recognised teacher training overseas. When employing an RTP trainee, schools need to work in partnership with a higher education institution, since participants must complete a degree at the same time as qualifying as a teacher. Participants in both of these programmes are required to hold mathematics, English and science standards. Grants of up to 4500 are paid by the Training and Development Agency to recommended bodies to help meet the training and assessment costs associated with GRTP trainees.Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-03-28",

The new guidance will: help teachers and other staff to keep children safe by outlining their duties and giving helpful advice help cut red tape by providing sample checklist forms to help save time give teachers and others more confidence to organise trips by highlighting helpful schemes like the Quality Badge highlight how employers should support their staff in the event of a child being hurt, so fears of legal action can be reduced It builds on the Quality Badge Scheme for providers, launched earlier in 2009, which cuts the paperwork that schools and others will need before organising visits to badged organisations and venues.

The guidance also makes clear that the law protects teachers in the rare event of someone being hurt on a school trip, and reassures them that they can give their pupils exciting, educational and valuable experiences by organising activities outside the classroom.

Since then HEAS has given information to many families and also to education authorities, other professionals, academic researchers, politicians, voluntary agencies, the media and other bodies. HEAS offers information for home educators including advice about educational materials, resources, GCSE examinations, special educational needs, information technology, legal matters and curriculum design. HEAS produces a range of leaflets and the Home Education Handbook. In addition HEAS subscribers receive the quarterly HEAS Bulletin, access to the Advice Line, contacts with other subscribers and the HEAS registration card (for home educating families) which gives free or reduced rates of admission to certain museums and sites of interest.Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-12",

A website is part of the final project which received support from the Department for Education and Skills SEN Small Programmes Fund. A CD-ROM of supportive teaching resources from the project was launched in January 2003. This was circulated to mainstream secondary schools and made available to special schools with the Science Enhancement Programme (SEP) supporting its reproduction and distribution. The outcomes are intended to be of practical use to the teacher in the classroom.

They represented positive intervention by the Government after it became clear that voluntary training effort by employers would not be sufficient to avoid recurring skill shortages. A succession of reviews in the 1980s/90s found that many ITBs had not made sufficient impact to justify their continuance and most Boards were wound up.  However, the construction and engineering construction industries felt that because they employed a highly mobile labour force with extensive use of labour-only subcontractors voluntary arrangements would not work. They argued strongly to retain statutory powers for the collective funding of training from which all employers would benefit. These special circumstances were recognised by the Government and it agreed to retain the CITB and the engineering construction part of the Engineering ITB (EITB). The EITB was subsequently re-named the ECITB to reflect its reduced scope. Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-05-31",

The Standard is based on three main principles:  Plan - Develop strategies to improve the performance of the organisation Do - Take action to improve the performance of the organisation Review - Evaluate the impact on the performance of the organisation  These three key principles are broken down into 10 indicators, against which organisations wishing to be recognised as an Investor in People are assessed. IiP assessors go to an employer and provide a detailed and rigorous challenge against the IiP standards. Assessment is undertaken through a network of 12 regional Quality Centres (9 in England and 1 each in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). Investors in People UK was set up as a Non-Departmental Public Body in 1993 to take ownership of the Standard.

They also recommended: improving links between HE institutions and schools and colleges - including about areas where HE-school/college links could raise attainment, and about measures to raise aspirations and widen participation in HE. improving partnerships between education providers themselves - crucially, that high-performing institutions should expect to play a wider role in supporting others, and that more work should be done to be clear about expectations and accountability, and also about improving links between maintained and independent schools.",

Our aims The aims of the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) are to raise levels of achievement in maths, and to increase appreciation of the power and wonder of maths, across the school, sixth form college and further education system. In this context, our specific task is to try to ensure that all teachers of maths - and this includes all primary school teachers, and non-specialist maths teachers - have easy access to high quality, evidence-based, maths-specific continuing professional development (CPD) at every point of their careers. The main channel of our support for teachers and schools is the Maths Hubs programme, which we lead and coordinate. In our interaction with primary schools and primary teachers, the majority of our support comes through the various strands of the Teaching for Mastery programme.Source: {NCETM|https://www.ncetm.org.ukcetm/about} accessed 2019-06-20",

It was introduced on 30 December 2008 and has funding until March 2011. The Programme, run by the Mentoring and Befriending Foundation, will work across England, to enable young people to provide support and advice to one another in schools and build friendships. The programme will work in schools and colleges and involve young people being trained to mentor their peers, listen to their problems and engage other young people in the community. As part of the National Peer Mentoring Programme, children and young people will: work with groups or individuals to resolve disputes through conflict resolution; develop befriending schemes which help to encourage friendships for those children who might otherwise struggle to fit in or to be accepted; be trained to listen to problems and support their peers. The Programme delivers a key commitment of the Aiming high for young people strategy to work with young people who have become disengaged with their community. By offering a young mentor to advice and support those young people experiencing difficult circumstances at school or at home, they can help make the transition to adulthood much easier. Pilot scheme The Programme follows a successful pilot scheme which involved 180 schools and engaged with 3,600 pupils. The pilots focused on attainment, behaviour, bullying and transition. The national programme will build on the pilots and is designed to apply to all young people in pre and post 16 education. Typically the young person requiring mentoring may be experiencing difficulties in education that are linked to language or social and communication skills.

The North East started receiving fruit in March 2004 with the remaining four regions (South East, Yorkshire & Humber, South West and East of England) all coming on stream in autumn 2004. Participation by schools is on a voluntary basis but the scheme is available to all. On 1 April 2010 Primary Care Trusts became responsible for the financing the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme for their area. The Department of Health will continue to negotiate and manage the Service Level Agreement (SLA), on behalf of PCTs, with NHS Supply Chain for England.

Once they have found a teaching position in a school, the Overseas Trained Teacher Programme (OTTP) will provide them with their own individual training and assessment programme which will ultimately lead to a qualification to teach in England permanently. Minimum qualifications Potential candidates must first be qualified as a teacher overseas and working as an unqualified teacher in a school in England. In addition, if they qualified outside the EEA they will need: a qualification equivalent to a UK bachelors degree a qualification equivalent to GCSE grade C or above in mathematics and English, and if they intend to teach primary or key stage 2/3 (ages 7-14), they must also have achieved a standard equivalent to a grade C in a GCSE science subject.

The first PEP should be agreed within 20 days of the child becoming looked after or joining a school. The PEP should be put together and be completed at a meeting in which the designated teacher, social worker and carers for the young person in public care are present. The child or young person should also be part of their education planning, either at the PEP meeting itself or through discussions outside that meeting. The PEP is intended as the overarching education plan, which is in turn an integral part of a child's Care Plan. A current PEP should always be available for review as part of the Care Plan. Departmental guidance stipulates that plans should be reviewed every six months. It is essential that a PEP meeting is held at any time of significant change",

Children attend every morning for two and half terms, returning to their home school for afternoon sessions. It aims to provide intensive learning support, raise self-esteem and develop positive learning behaviour. Each unit is for a maximum of 10 children. The PLSUs are for: -Children who are not working to their full potential, yet have the cognitive ability to achieve at least Level 4. -Children must be working at a minimum of National Curriculum Level 3c. -Children who may display negative learning behaviour, manifesting itself disruptively or by withdrawal. Unlike the Pupil Referral Unit, it is not the function of the PLSU to work with those children whose behaviour is so disruptive that it prevents learning from taking place. Content Sessions include: -Regular setting and reviewing of individual targets, encouraging the children to become independent and reflective learners. -Intense literacy and numeracy sessions to secure knowledge and key skills needed for SATs. -Using ICT as a tool to motivate and stimulate children's interest. -Circle time sessions to raise self esteem and promote positive behaviour management. -Understanding that we all learn in different ways and becoming aware of how we learn best.Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-15",

As a result of the need to demonstrate the educational value that playgroups offer to young children, the charity's members voted for a formal change of name to Pre-school Learning Alliance in 1995 and also adopted a new corporate logo.

RISE reports have covered many issues of particular interest to parents e.g. class size, school reports, home-school agreements, parental involvement in Ofsted inspections, school complaints procedures and school admissions. Research has been funded by various trusts, including the Nuffield Foundation and the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation. The most recent project researched the role of Parent Governor Representatives. Since 2003 all RISE research projects have been published via the Internet.  As well as seeking support for further research projects RISE is working on its information centre, an online catalogue of official on-line education data. This is intended to prove a valuable resource to researchers, information officers and journalists as well as parents, teachers and governors. RISE reports have covered many issues of particular interest to parents e.g. class size, school reports, home-school agreements, parental involvement in Ofsted inspections, school complaints procedures, school admissions and the role of parent governor representatives.Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-12",

The approach is significantly different to the approaches used in England in a number of regards: Use of realistic situations as a means of developing pupils mathematics as opposed to using contexts as an introduction to mathematics or as an application of mathematics. Less emphasis on algorithms and more on sense making and gradual refinement of informal procedures. Emphasis on refining and systematising understanding. Less emphasis on linking single lessons to direct content acquisition and more on gradual development over a longer period of time. Greater emphasis on research into learning and teaching and of trialling and refining materials in schools. Use of guided reinvention rather than discovery learning or teachers explaining. Internationally RME is recognised as a very effective approach to teaching mathematics content (TIMSS 2003) and mathematical problem solving (PISA 2001).Source: The Knowledge accessed 2019-04-12",

In 1983, SHA took a step forward when members overwhelmingly voted to admit deputy heads as full members, thus becoming the first association to recognise the specific role of the senior leadership team. With the growing recognition of and need for shared leadership responsibility, SHA opened membership to assistant heads in 1999 and to bursars and other senior support staff on the leadership team in 2005. By 2005, two-thirds of SHA members were in roles other than that of head. Therefore to better reflect the true makeup of the association, in January 2006, members voted to change the name to the Association of School and College Leaders.Source: {ASCL website|https://www.ascl.org.uk/about-us/history-of-ascl.html} accessed 2019-05-31",

Our ambition is for teachers to be able to do so without having to pursue traditional leadership routes, instead expanding their expertise in vital areas such as curriculum or behaviour management. The expert panel draws on a range of experience from across the school system, including curriculum experts, current school leaders and leading academics. The group will play an essential role in helping to ensure all the qualifications are aligned in order to maximise the benefits for teachers. The professional qualifications will build on the landmark Early Career Framework, which is set to be backed by at least 130 million a year when fully rolled out. The framework is a two-year package of training and support at the start of a teachers career will include a reduced timetable to allow teachers to make the most of their training.Source: {GOV.UK|https://www.gov.uk/governmentewsew-qualifications-to-help-teachers-progress-their-careers} accessed 2019-10-22",

Staying Safe was launched for consultation in July 2007, and during the consultation period, the Department spoke to parents, children and young people, members of the general public and practitioners about their concerns in relation to children's safety. The Action Plan set out the work which Government took forward over the next three years to drive improvements in children and young people's safety, which will be measured by the new PSA to improve children and young people's safety.  The Staying Safe Action Plan covers three main areas: 1.Universal safeguarding, involving work to keep all children and young people safe and to create safe environments for them 2.Targeted safeguarding to reduce the risks of harm for vulnerable groups of children and young people 3.Responsive safeguarding, involving responding effectively when children are harmed  The Action Plan set out new commitments on children's safety, including a new \u00c2\u00a318m home safety equipment scheme targeted at vulnerable areas, a Child Safety Education Coalition and a new National Safeguarding Unit for the Third Sector. Publication of new guidance The Government announced the publication of new guidance on the safeguarding of disabled children on 9 July 2009. The guidance, produced by the Children's Society on behalf of the Government, advises local organisations on how to best safeguard and promote the welfare of disabled children.

The programme provides opportunities for teachers in England to develop their teaching skills, by experiencing alternative practice in a number of key themes through short-term international study visits. Such visits also aim to create valuable international links between schools, facilitating international school partnerships and information sharing on a global level. The Programme provides 2580 places per year. Itis delivered by four providers: the British Council (BC), the League for the Exchange of Commonwealth Teachers (LECT), the HTI (HTI) and the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT). Each Local Authority (LA) in England has its own allocation of places. Since the programme was launched, TIPD participants have visited countries across the world including Singapore, Australia, Hungary, China, Sweden and the USA to study themes such as ICT, special educational needs (SEN), citizenship and literacy. The Programme enables teachers to learn from, and contribute to, educational ideas and best practice in schools throughout the world, helping to support teachers in raising standards of teaching and learning both in England and abroad. The programme has a number of different strands with a range of opportunities available to teachers and LAs.

The pilot is being run in 9 areas within England until September 2005, and offers opportunities for 820 young people for whom finance is the main barrier to participate in volunteering. This full-time initiative (full-time is defined as more than 30 hours per week) will target 18 and 19 year olds who have completed their programmes of post-16 learning with the support of an Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA), or were eligible for Income Support while undertaking vocational training. The age range will be extended to 21 years for young people with special needs or disabilities. Volunteers will receive a weekly allowance of 45, and an end of experience award of 750 after completing 9 months experience. The pilot will also seek to enhance the personal development of the volunteers in such areas as communication, personal planning, teamwork and leadership skills as well as their commitment to further learning, employment and volunteering.

The iEOA like its predecessor remains the only independent professional organisation of its kind in the UK and abroad and will continue to lobby establishment on behalf of its community through its strong charitable ethos. But unlike its predecessor which was supported and funded by government around the supporting the exam systems in operation, the iEOA is returning to its roots that revolve around centre needs and those communities and not just around facilitating an exam system in which this community has had very little say in or influence on over the years.

Those young people were more likely than others of drifting out of learning and into long-term disaffection. The aim of the u-project was to aid the transition from secondary school to adult life, by providing a structured programme of challenging activity and high-quality advice and guidance to encourage participants to remain in education or to take up training or employment. Activities on the programme were designed to offer the young people personal challenges, an opportunity to reflect, and a sense of achievement.Funding from the Big Lottery Fund ended in December 2004.",
